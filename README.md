# 💳 Secure Financial Web App

## 📌 Overview
The **Secure Financial Web App** is our final year engineering project focused on building a **safe, scalable, and user-friendly platform** for managing financial transactions online.  
It integrates modern **web security practices**, **real-time transaction monitoring**, and **data protection techniques** to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Provide a secure platform for handling financial transactions.
- Implement **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** and **role-based access control (RBAC)**.
- Protect user data using **end-to-end encryption** and **secure hashing (e.g., bcrypt/Argon2)**.
- Detect and mitigate common vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, SSRF, etc.).
- Ensure compliance with **OWASP Top 10** and industry best practices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Frontend:** React.js 
**Backend:** Node.js (Express) 
**Database:** MongoDB (with encryption at rest)  
**Authentication:** JWT + OAuth2.0 + MFA  
**Security Add-ons:** Helmet.js, Rate Limiting, Input Validation, TLS/SSL  
**DevOps:** Docker, GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Deployment on AWS / Azure / GCP

## 🔐 Security Features
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: OTP/email/phone verification.  
- **Encrypted Transactions** using HTTPS/TLS and secure key management.  
- **Real-time Fraud Detection** using anomaly detection algorithms.  
- **Audit Logging** for compliance and incident response.  
- **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)** for different user types (admin, user, auditor).  
- **Data Privacy Compliance** (GDPR-inspired design).
